| Level of Care           | AI Type       | Functional Role                                 | Response Rate               |
| ----------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Inpatient (Operational) | Embodied AI   | Integrates all layers, adaptive and operational | Variable - Discharge        |
| Outpatient (Strategic)  | Generative AI | Plans, creates, simulates scenarios             | Weeks - Month               |
| Urgent Care (Ritual)    | Agentic AI    | Performs routine, reliable tasks                | Days - Week                 |
| Emergency (Tactical)    | Perception AI | Detects, senses, reacts in real-time            | Minutes - Hour              |
| First Aid (Existential) | World AI      | Understands environment/context; foundational   | Seconds - Minutes           |

### Step 2: Narrative (Bottom-to-Top Flow)

* **Inpatient / Embodied AI**: At the operational core, integrates all AI layers and adapts to complex environments. Think of this as the nervous system coordinating all other layers.
* **Outpatient / Generative AI**: Strategically plans and generates new possibilities, supporting decision-making and exploration.
* **Urgent Care / Agentic AI**: Executes repeatable, reliable tasks efficiently — the “ritual” layer that maintains system stability.
* **Emergency / Perception AI**: Reacts in real-time to environmental stimuli, providing immediate feedback for critical situations.
* **First Aid / World AI**: Provides existential context, the foundational understanding of the environment that informs all other layers.

This orientation aligns naturally with a **digital twin / nervous system analogy**, where the **most foundational contextual AI is at the top**, feeding into increasingly integrated, operational layers at the bottom.
