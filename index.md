## AI as Healthcare Levels: A Framework for WHO-India

### The Stack (Bottom-to-Top)

| Level | Care Type | AI Type | Function | Response [Time]() | Market Signal |
|-------|-----------|---------|----------|---------------|---------------|
| ⚪ **5** | **Inpatient** | Embodied AI | Integrates all layers into adaptive, physical systems | Aperiodic / On Discharge | Emerging |
| 🔵 **4** | **Outpatient** | Generative AI | Creates content, plans scenarios, explores possibilities | Weeks - Month | $50B+ ARR (2025) |
| 🟢 **3** | **Urgent Care** | Agentic AI | Executes workflows, automates routine decisions | Days - Week | **$100B ARR (2029)** |
| 🟡 **2** | **Emergency** | Perception AI | Detects patterns, senses changes, triggers alerts | Minutes - Hour | Foundation |
| 🔴 **1** | **First Aid** | World AI | Contextual understanding of environment/domain | Seconds - Minutes | Infrastructure |

### Reading the Stack

**Bottom-Up (Foundation → Integration)**
1. **First Aid / World AI** provides baseline context (maps, sensors, knowledge graphs)
2. **Emergency / Perception AI** monitors for signals requiring attention
3. **Urgent Care / Agentic AI** responds with autonomous workflows ← **explosive growth zone**
4. **Outpatient / Generative AI** supports planning and creative problem-solving
5. **Inpatient / Embodied AI** coordinates physical-digital integration in complex scenarios

**Why Emergency at Bottom?** 
- OpenAI projects **Agentic AI = $100B ARR by 2029** (their largest growth segment)
- Agents require reliable perception infrastructure to function
- Like healthcare: emergency departments need triage protocols (perception) before treatment (agency)
- Foundation enables scale; the action layer captures value

### For WHO-India Context

**Vocabulary Expansion:** Instead of asking "should we use AI?", ask:
- Do we need **World AI** to map health system context?
- Do we need **Perception AI** to detect disease outbreaks?
- Do we need **Agentic AI** to automate vaccine logistics? ← **highest ROI zone**
- Do we need **Generative AI** to create training materials?
- Do we need **Embodied AI** for robotic surgery at scale?

**Investment Signal:** The market is betting on the middle layer (agents doing work), but it requires the bottom layers to function reliably.
